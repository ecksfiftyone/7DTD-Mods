  - Higher chance traders stock solar cells.
  - Added solar bank bundle (low possibility) in some things like air drops and quest rewards.
  - Added recipes to craft solar. (Expensive)


  - Increases Solar Cell output to match batteries.

This is due to the fact that electricity works wrong. 
Solar -> battery -> item should use battery power while the solar cells charge the batteries.
Since the devices ignore batteries and OLY use solar, AND you cant daisychain Solar, it needed to change.
